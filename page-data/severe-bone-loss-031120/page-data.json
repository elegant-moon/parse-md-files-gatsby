It was at a different office. About 2 years ago the patient started coming to my practice for followup. #18 implant had severe bone loss but is still osseointegrated. The gingiva is firm and appears healthy without bleeding or purulence. The patient is asymptomatic. I believe the bone loss was from a TMJ appliance that was overloading the implant. Initially I adjusted the occlusion in 12/2018. I then found out in 8/2019 that she has been wearing a TMJ appliance that was putting pressure on the implant crown. Is it acceptable to observe or be proactive? Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\n<div class=\"foogallery foogallery-container foogallery-default foogallery-lightbox-foobox fg-gutter-10 fg-center fg-default fg-light fg-border-thin fg-shadow-small fg-loading-default fg-loaded-fade-in fg-custom fg-caption-hover fg-hover-fade fg-hover-zoom\" data-fg-common-fields=\"1\" data-foogallery=\"{\"item\":{\"showCaptionTitle\":true,\"showCaptionDescription\":true},\"lazy\":true,\"src\":\"data-src-fg\",\"srcset\":\"data-srcset-fg\"}\" id=\"foogallery-gallery-32667\"><div class=\"fg-item\"><figure class=\"fg-item-inner\">[<span class=\"fg-image-wrap\">![]()</span>](https://www.osseonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20303-24-x04882_1-e6918f7a3794.jpg)<figcaption class=\"fg-caption\"><div class=\"fg-caption-inner\"></div></figcaption></figure><div class=\"fg-loader\"></div></div><div class=\"fg-item\"><figure class=\"fg-item-inner\">[<span class=\"fg-image-wrap\">![]()</span>](https://www.osseonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20303-24-x04882-e6918f7a3794.jpg)<figcaption class=\"fg-caption\"><div class=\"fg-caption-inner\"></div></figcaption></figure><div class=\"fg-loader\"></div></div></div>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 11, 2020","permalink":"/severe-bone-loss-031120","title":"Severe bone loss 10 years after placement: advice?","thumbnail":"/assets/wow-moon.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
